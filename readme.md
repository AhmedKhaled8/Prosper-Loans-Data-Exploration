New York, Texas, and Florida come next with more than 4500 borrower for each. Wyoming is the least.                                                                                                                                                     |

Looking in more detail, we can observe that around 6000 lenders (8.5%) use exactly 30%, it is the most common percentage among all lenders. Not too many use a percentage higher than 30% or less than 10%.                                                                              |

Executives, administrative assistants and teachers come in second, third and fourth with about 3000 each (4.25%). Many jobs have about 2000 instances. Tradesman - Mechanic is the 25th in all occupations with about 700.                                                                                                    |

Full-time was specified separately by 5 thousands so as Self-employed. Not too many retired or not-employed people were recorded in the data set.                                                                                                                        |

Surprisingly, No borrower stated that his monthly income is in the range of 7000-8000.                                                                                                                                                           |

|    LoanOriginalAmount    |                          The histogram should a multi-modal curve. This may be reasonable as the company may provide discrete specific amounts of loans                          | The distribution of the amounts of loans starts from 1000 increasing until it reaches it's first peak at 5000, 12000 borrowers were granted loan amount of 5000\$. The curve then decreases but suddenly has a sharp rise to 10000 \$. Actually 8000 borrowers granted this amount as a loan. The curve decreases again and again a sudden rise to the amount of 15000 \$ which has 8000 borrowers. The same happens and we may find rises at 20000\$ and 25000\$ with 1800 borrowers for each amount. |

Nearly for each of the previous interest rates, about 5000 borrowers are recorded.                                                                                                                                                   |

A line with a positive slope can be fitted between the points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|      IncomeRange      | LoanOriginalAmount |   Violin / Box  | The borrowers with the 'Not employed' and the borrowers with income in the range of 1-25K share the same distribution in the amount of loan with a mean of qbout 4000\$. The range of amounts increase with the increase of the income. A borrower with an income in the range of 50K-75K \$ are less likeable to have a loan amount greater than 15K\$. The distribution of the loan amount in the case of the income range (100K+) is quitely flat, the majority in this category are recieving loan of amount of just less than 15K\$. Still, it is also likely if you are in this category to get more amounts than those in the (50K-75K). |

The majority of the borrowers who have a rating of 4, 5, 6, 7 got loans with amount in the range (5000, 15000). Surprisingly, the highest amount listed in the data is in the rating 6 not 7. Nearly all borrowers with a rating of 1 gets loans of 4500 \$, even if others with rating 1 got more than 5000\$.                                                                                                       |

With high ratings, the number of investors increases with the acknowledge of being in a group more than individually.                                        |
|      IncomeRange      | LoanOriginalAmount | ProsperRating_numeric |     Point     | Considering taking each Prosper rating separately, we can deduce that the amount change of the loan is higher with the change in the income level in the ratings of 4, 5, 6, and 7. The ratings of 1, 2, and 3 don't show that high gradient. Surprisingly, A rating of 7 showed a lower mean of loan amount that lower ratings 5, and 6. |
